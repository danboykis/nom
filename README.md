# nom

Utilities for working with the happy path in the face of anomalies.

(The name »nom« is a bad pun on the word »anomaly«.  »Anomaly« is actually
composed from »an-« and »homalos«, so the antonym of »anomal« should be »homal«.
However, a funny name is obviously more important than etymological accuracy.)
